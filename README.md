## Todo

* Update tests as the baseline is currently broken
* Add additional endpoints
* Speak to Dave about the work that needs to be done to fix the test and if there are any good Jest examples
* Enforce the spec on the API to get cleaner content in the datastore
* Work out if different tests for the same endpoint need to go in a different file or if they can stay in the same one
